# [Name TBD]
A simple Electron application for rendering both images and videos of the Mandelbrot set. 

## Usage
WASD/Arrow keys to move x and y coordinates 

Z/X to zoom in and out

Pixel 1 and Pixel 2 inputs control the start and end point of the color gradient

Set color determines the color of pixels apart of the Mandelbrot set

Gradient repetitions control how many times the gradient is repeated across the render

Bookmarks can be set by declaring a name and using the add bookmark button. 

By inputting the names of two different bookmarks, and an amount of frames, a video panning between the two points can be rendered
